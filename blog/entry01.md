I choose business for this freedom project because I want to be able to start a business that i would be helpful to the community. I have seen a lot of business owners lose their business because they have financial challenges and I want to be able to expand my knowledge about business so i dont get myself into these kinds of problems. My back up idea was programming and 3D animation because they both were interesting and were something I would be interested in if business wasn't something I want to do in the future. The website https://www.deca.org/ prepares emerging leaders and entrepreneurs for careers in marketing, finance, hospitality, and management. This shows the website DECA teaches us how to lead successfully by establishing goals, gaining agreement, and accomplishing tasks while showing creativity and invention, communication and teamwork, analytical thinking, and problem solving. Another website i used is https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-business/ teaches us how to make a website for your small business. This is useful because for someone who needs a website for a business would need to follow these steps to create a website and be globally known when expanding the business worldwide.
